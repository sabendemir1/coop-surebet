• **Complex Data Processing**: Different bookmakers use inconsistent market formats and naming
• **Manual Detection**: Finding arbitrage opportunities requires constant monitoring across dozens of bookmakers  
• **Validation Complexity**: Ensuring bets are truly opposite and compatible for settlement
• **Technical Barriers**: Most arbitrage tools lack sophisticated validation for player-specific or time-based bets

Existing solutions often miss subtle arbitrage opportunities or generate false positives due to poor data normalization.igent Sports Arbitrage Platform

📖 Overview

Coop-SureBet is an advanced arbitrage detection and management platform that helps users identify and execute profitable sports betting opportunities across multiple bookmakers. The platform combines sophisticated rule-based algorithms with AI-ready data structures to provide comprehensive arbitrage analysis.

Our intelligent system normalizes betting data from various sources, detects arbitrage opportunities with mathematical precision, and provides tools for manual arbitrage creation and validation.

📖 Overview

ArbiMatch is an experimental platform that enables users to safely participate in sports arbitrage betting without requiring accounts on multiple bookmakers.
Instead of placing both sides of an arbitrage themselves, two users are matched — each taking opposite sides of a game’s outcome — allowing them to profit from price differences across bookmakers while keeping control of their own accounts.

All balances and bets are simulated. No real money is accepted or paid out.

💡 Problem

Traditional arbitrage betting requires:

Dozens of bookmaker accounts across regions.

Constant monitoring of odds and quick reactions.

Risk of account bans and stake limits.


Most people, even those who understand arbitrage, can’t actually do it — they lack multiple verified bookmaker accounts, technical tools, or time.


---

🚀 Solution

ArbiMatch introduces a peer-to-peer arbitrage system that:

1. Matches users who hold accounts at different bookmakers.


2. Calculates fair stakes and deposits based on live odds.


3. Locks both users’ deposits on the platform as guarantees.


4. Both users execute their own bets at their bookmaker.


5. Once the outcome is known, the winner’s profit (edge) is split between:

The winner user

The matched user

The platform (commission)




This enables anyone to profit from bookmaker price discrepancies without needing 20 accounts or breaking bookmaker rules.


---

⚙️ How It Works (Demo Flow)

1. Matchmaking

User A selects a bet on Bookmaker A (e.g., Team X to Win at 2.15).

User B selects a matching opposite bet on Bookmaker B (e.g., Team Y + Draw at 1.95).

The system detects an arbitrage and pairs them automatically.



2. Deposit Calculation

Each user deposits an amount equal to their opponent’s stake + a small edge margin (used for payouts and fees).



3. Confirmation Window

Both users have 2 minutes to verify odds and prepare their bets.

Odds are rechecked via API every second to detect sudden changes.



4. Execution

Once both click “Ready,” deposits are locked, and users manually confirm bets at their bookmaker.



5. Settlement

When the event ends:

The losing side’s deposit transfers to the winner.

The winner’s edge is split ⅓ platform, ⅔ users (proportional to stake).




6. Transparency

Every action is logged and traceable via blockchain-style receipts (planned).

🌱 Ethical & Safety Design

Emphasizes risk transparency — users are shown potential bookmaker issues before confirmation.

Supports tiered limits to avoid over-exposure.

Prioritizes education and simulation for new users.

No gambling promotion — this is a financial coordination platform, not a bookmaker.



---

🧠 Research Potential

This project explores:

Distributed arbitrage coordination algorithms

Delay-tolerant execution in financial betting systems

Market efficiency and fairness under latency constraints

Regulation of hybrid gambling-financial systems


> 💬 It’s suitable as a Master’s thesis topic for advanced computing, fintech, or distributed systems — covering both technical and regulatory innovation.
